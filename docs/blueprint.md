## Core Features:

- Authentication: Simple username/password based authentication. User vinicius@teste.com with password 123456 will be the initial administrator.
- Dashboard: Dashboard interface with at-a-glance views of key metrics and information, as a launchpad to other, more detailed screens.
- User Management: User management section: view, create, and disable/enable user accounts.
- Role Management: Role management section: create and edit user roles. Assign permissions to each role.
- AI-Powered Activity Log: Activity Logging with AI-powered insights: LLM will function as a tool which parses user activities in the panel and flags suspicious or unusual behavior based on login patterns, data access, and changes to system settings. Provides admins with clear summaries and alerts.
- Config settings: The admin panel will include the ability to manage application configurations.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#667EEA) to convey trust and authority.
- Background color: Light gray (#F7FAFC), almost white, for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Teal (#4FD1C5) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for clear and professional readability.
- Use a consistent set of line icons from a library like Font Awesome or Remix Icon for a modern and clean aesthetic.
- Use a responsive grid layout to adapt to different screen sizes. Maintain a consistent margin and padding throughout the panel.
- Subtle transitions and animations (e.g., hover effects, loading spinners) to provide feedback and enhance the user experience.
